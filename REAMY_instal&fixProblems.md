SIMPLE INSTALATION:
Create an UI Canvas and call it "VirtualJoystic"; VERY IMPORTANTE TO HAVE THIS NAME
In that canvas, create an Image and call it "Background_Joystic_Move", and drag the "VirtualJoystic.cs" script in side of tham.
In that image, that means in side of that Image, create another Image call "Joystic_Look_Image"
On the player GameObject "if you dont have, create a simple 3D esfere"  and drag the "Player_Script.cs" script in tham.
                                                      AND HAVE FUN


PROBLEMS FIX:
If not working or have an error on joystick, like the central image disappear and are giving an error, try to change the Public variable "Joystick Distance from Background" in the Image "Background_Joystic_Move" on the canvas call "VirtualJoystick"   to an number. We suggest  the number "2".
